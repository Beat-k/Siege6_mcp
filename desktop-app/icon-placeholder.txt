# This is a placeholder for the app icon
# You'll need to add a proper icon.png file (256x256 recommended)
# You can create one using tools like:
# - https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
# - GIMP, Photoshop, or any image editor
# - Convert to PNG format

# For now, the app will work without an icon but show a default one
